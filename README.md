# stousn.dev Homepage
Homepage located at [stousn.dev](https://stousn.dev)

## Purpose
A homepage to show my open source projects, provide a description for them and show the readme file.

## Technologies
### VanillaJS SPA
Recently I reengineered the whole SPA. Altough, the UI looks more or less the same, I switched from self-written vanilla JS code to a lightweight framework called [VanillaJS SPA](https://github.com/rishavs/vanillajs-spa) developed by Rishav Sharan ([rishavs](https://github.com/rishavs)) and available under MIT Licence here on GitHub. I changed it to meet my requirements though.

### Marked
To display all readme.md files of my projects in a formated way, I make use of [Marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked). It is developed by Christopher Jeffrey and available under MIT License here on GitHub.

### W3.CSS
A lightweight CSS Framework I use in most of my projects is [W3.CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/). My design is based on [W3.CSS Material Design](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_material.asp). W3.CSS is free to use. No license is necessary.

### GitHub Actions
I use a GitHub workflow to automatically deploy the masters head to firebase. The script for that purpose is located in this repo under [.github/workflows/main.yml](https://github.com/Stousn/stousn_dev_homepage/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml)
