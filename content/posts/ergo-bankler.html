<p>A simple homepage for my girlfriend and local occupational therapist Vanessa Bankler.<br>
<a target="_blank" href="https://ergotherapie-bankler.at">ergotherapie-bankler.at</a></p>

<b>The Project</b>
<p>Besides being employed, Vanessa provides self-employed mobile occupational therapy. 
    To give information about her services and also provide contact possibilities and a 
    price list, we decided to create a homepage.</p>
<b>Technologies</b>
<p>It is a single-page app, because it uses just one page. 
    Imprint and privacy terms are implemented as modal. All important information is displayed in a CV-style.
    The page is written with plain HTML and CSS - not even JavaScript is used. 
    For the UI I decided to use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css">W3.CSS</a>. 
    I make use of a template called 'CV Template' also provided from W3C.
</p>
<b>Status</b>
<p>The page is live and can be viewd at 
    <a target="_blank" href="https://ergo-bankler.at">ergo-bankler.at</a> and 
    <a target="_blank" href="https://ergotherapie-bankler.at">ergotherapie-bankler.at</a>.
    Currently only content maintenance is done. However, next year a re-design will be done. 
    The color will be changed from orange to cyan to match the new CI.
