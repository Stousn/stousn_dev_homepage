<p>The development of my blog <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.stousn.at">blog.stousn.at</a></p>

<b>The Project</b>
<p>I had blogs earlier during school time and my full time study. However, during part time studying I had no time for it. 
    But now, as I finished at FH JOANNEUM, I created a new blog to share my photographs, ideas, thoughts and videos.
</p>
<b>Technologies</b>
<p>I wanted to write my blog-posts very simple with Markdown, because I use Markdown 
    for nearly any text i write. So I searched for solutions and found <a target="_blank" href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. A software written in Go
    that creates static HTML pages from Markdown. I host the blog on GitHub pages.
</p>
<b>Status</b>
<p>The blog is live and you view it at <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.stousn.at">blog.stousn.at</a>. 
    Currently, I just need to write more/frequent posts.
