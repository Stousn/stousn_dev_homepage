<b>Problem</b>
<p>Apple has it's own ecosystem. It's clearly separated form other platforms which is due to the fact that Apple provides
software and hardware. Nevertheless, Apple develops different operating systems for different purposes. For desktop and
laptop pcs there is macOS, iOS is a mobile operating system for smartphone and tablet and then there are tvOS for Apple
TV and watchOS for smartwatch. For obvious reasons watchOS and iOS are very tight coupled and Apple watch apps are
actually just a part of an iOS application. For desktop software it is different. Tough, some apps developed by Apple
itself - like Safari - already make it possible to hand over the state between iOS and macOS it still is a completely
different architecture. Until now it is not possible to run exactly the same iOS app on macOS.</p>

<b>Method</b>
<p>The method consists of the following steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Research work on existing methods to use iOS apps on macOS</li>
    <li>Choose one method paying attention to the criteria below</li>
    <li>Development of one demo application (prototype)</li>
</ol>
<b>Status</b>
<p>The project is finished and was submitted and graded. 
    The solution was implemented using Electron and Ionic.</p>
