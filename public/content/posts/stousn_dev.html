<p>This development page <a target="_blank"  href="https://stousn.dev">stousn.dev</a></p>

<b>The Project</b>
<p>When the TLD .dev was released in 2018, I wanted one. But then - during my master studies - 
    I had no idea what to put there. Later, I added an overview of all current and past projects that I
    want to share.
</p>
<b>Technologies</b>
<p>The first page was a 1:1 copy of <a target="_blank" href="https://stousn.at">my homepage</a> with just some different content.
    In summer 2019 I changed the main page to display README.md files of my GitHub projects.
    Therefore, I used a Framework to parse Markdown to HTML.
    As the page was a bit obsolete - I could've just let my domain point to github itself - I changed it.
    I didn't change the UI but the whole logic and how the SPA works in background is completely different now.
    I used <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rishavs/vanillajs-spa">a 
        project called vanillajs-spa by rishavs</a> and adapted it to my needs.
</p>
<b>Status</b>
<p>The page is live and you view it just at the moment.
    For the future some more projects are planed to be listed here.
