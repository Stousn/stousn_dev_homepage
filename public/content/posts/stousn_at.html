<p>My homepage <a target="_blank" href="https://stousn.at">stousn.at</a></p>

<b>The Project</b>
<p>
    As a developer, I - of course - need my homepage. I normally don't know what to put there, but I wrote a view paragraphs. More interesting to me is the build process. Thus, the content is not
    perfect.
</p>
<b>Technologies</b>
<p>
    I wanted to write a single page application. I did this with vanilla.js and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css">W3.CSS</a>. The different pages are html files that
    dynamically get loaded when a page is selected. The homepage is very lightweight and uses no frameworks besides an Icon-font. A newer feature is the domain detection, as I wanted the title of the
    page to depend on the url that is used.
</p>
<b>Status</b>
<p>
    The page is live and can be viewd at <a target="_blank" href="https://stefanreip.at">stousn.at</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://stousn.at">stefanreip.at</a> (Mind the different titles and
    headings). Currently only content maintenance is done.
